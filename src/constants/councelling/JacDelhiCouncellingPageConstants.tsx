Joint Admission Committee (JAC) for admission counselling to Undergraduate Programmes in Delhi Government funded premier universities, offering Engineering, Architecture and Management programmes started in the year 2014, as an initiative of the Govt. of NCT of Delhi, to avoid multiple admission counselling and save the candidates and their guardian from the resulting inconvenience because of shifting of students from one institution to the other during the admission process. 

This year, Delhi Technological University (DTU), Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIITD), Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT) and Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU) are participating in JAC for their B.Tech programmes, which is being conducted online with the support of the National Informatics Centre (NIC).

The admissions are done on the basis of rank of students in Joint Entrance Examination, JEE (Main) conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). Last  year, 7333 seats in Engineering offered by the five participating institutions, and 90 seats in B. Arch offered by two participating institutions are to be allotted through JAC Delhi counselling. 

The counselling procedure and schedule will be made available on the JAC Delhi website jac delhi.admissions.nic.in. Candidates and their parents/guardians are advised to regularly visit the JAC Delhi website.
